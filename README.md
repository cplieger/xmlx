[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cplieger/xmlx.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cplieger/xmlx) [![Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/cplieger/xmlx)](https://github.com/cplieger/xmlx/blob/main/go.mod) [![Mutation](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cplieger/xmlx/badges/mutation.json)](https://github.com/cplieger/xmlx/issues?q=label%3Agremlins-tracker)

xmlx caps the memory and work an untrusted XML document can cost your Go program, before and during an `encoding/xml` decode.

A byte cap on the response body does not bound the decode, because `encoding/xml` builds each token before your code can check it. xmlx adds those bounds and keeps your decoder. It uses only the standard library, needs Go 1.27 or later, is a stable v1 module under semantic versioning and is licensed under Apache-2.0.

## Why use it

xmlx is built for Go code that decodes XML it did not write, such as an RSS or Atom feed or a third-party API reply.

- `Preflight` scans the raw bytes once, with no allocation, and refuses an oversized text run or tag, too many attributes, elements or nesting levels, and any XML directive such as a DOCTYPE.
- A `Budget` caps each decoded value and the document's total decoded text while the value is still being read.
- Every rejection wraps one sentinel, `ErrLimit`, and names the bound. A `Preflight` rejection also gives the byte offset. No rejection quotes the document.
- A bound of zero or less is a configuration error, so no setting silently means unbounded.

Consider [mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator](https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator) if your security depends on the document's shape, such as XML signature validation or SAML. It rejects input that does not survive an `encoding/xml` round trip, and it pairs with `Preflight`.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/cplieger/xmlx@latest
```

## Usage

Run `Preflight` on the body before the decoder sees it:

```go
if err := xmlx.Preflight(body, xmlx.DefaultLimits()); err != nil {
	return err // a *xmlx.LimitError naming the bound and the byte offset
}

var doc feed
if err := xml.Unmarshal(body, &doc); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

With plain `xml.Unmarshal`, `Preflight` is the whole gate. A `Budget` works where you read tokens yourself, in a hand-written decoder or an `UnmarshalXML` method. Create one `Budget` per document and read each text field through it. `DecodeText` replaces `d.DecodeElement(&s, &start)` and refuses the value as soon as it grows past either cap:

```go
budget, err := xmlx.NewBudget(4<<10, 4<<20) // per value, per document
if err != nil {
	return err
}

d := xml.NewDecoder(bytes.NewReader(body))
var title, guid string
for {
	tok, err := d.Token()
	if err == io.EOF {
		break
	}
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	start, ok := tok.(xml.StartElement)
	if !ok {
		continue
	}
	switch start.Name.Local {
	case "title":
		title, err = budget.DecodeText(d)
	case "guid":
		guid, err = budget.DecodeText(d)
	}
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
}
fmt.Println(title, guid, budget.Total())
```

For a value the decoder has already handed you whole, such as an attribute value, call `budget.Charge(a.Value)` before you store it. In custom `UnmarshalXML` methods, give every element's decoder the same `*Budget`, and use `d.Skip()` for children you do not model. A value from `DecodeText` is already charged, so charge each value once. After any error from `DecodeText`, abandon the document. [How xmlx bounds a document](docs/design.md#how-decodetext-differs-from-decodeelement) has the detail.

To add the gate to a working integration, log the `Preflight` error and decode anyway until your bounds are proven, so a mis-sized bound shows up in your logs instead of breaking the feed.

The package examples on pkg.go.dev show the gate, a rejection, a refused directive, the `Budget` loop and a value split across CDATA sections, and `go test` keeps them true.

## API

- `Preflight` is the raw-byte gate, and `Limits` with `DefaultLimits` holds its five bounds.
- `NewBudget` and `DefaultBudget` create the decode-time text accounting for one document, with `DecodeText`, `Charge`, `Total`, `Remaining`, `MaxFieldBytes` and `MaxTotalBytes`.
- `LimitError`, `Kind` and `ErrLimit` describe a rejection. Match the class with `errors.Is(err, xmlx.ErrLimit)` and read `Kind`, `Limit` and `Offset` with `errors.AsType[*xmlx.LimitError](err)`.
- `ConfigError` and `ErrInvalidLimits` report a bound set to zero or less. That is a setup mistake, and it never wraps `ErrLimit`.

## Sizing the bounds

The defaults suit a small structured document, such as a feed or an API reply. They are a starting point.

| Bound | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `MaxTextRunBytes` | 64 KiB |
| `MaxTokenBytes` | 128 KiB |
| `MaxTagAttrs` | 16 |
| `MaxDepth` | 64 |
| `MaxElements` | 100,000 |
| `Budget` per value | 4 KiB |
| `Budget` per document | 4 MiB |

Set `MaxTextRunBytes` to at least six times the `Budget` per-value cap. An entity such as `&quot;` is six raw bytes that decode to one, so a smaller raw bound refuses values the `Budget` would keep. When your schema nests as deeply as the document, keep `MaxDepth` at 10000 or below, or 5000 on wasm. A catalogue-scale document will exceed `MaxElements` and the document cap, so set both from its real ceiling. For a compressed body, run `Preflight` on the inflated bytes. [How xmlx bounds a document](docs/design.md) explains each bound.

## Unsupported by design

- XML directives. `Preflight` refuses every `<!DOCTYPE`, `<!ENTITY`, `<!ATTLIST` and `<!NOTATION`. Decode a document that needs one under a byte cap and a `Budget` instead.
- XXE and DTD-defined entity expansion. `encoding/xml` does not resolve external entities or expand entities declared in a DTD.
- Round-trip stability, which a round-trip validator covers.
- Schema validation, namespace policy, character-encoding conversion and well-formedness, which stay with `encoding/xml`.
- Streaming from an `io.Reader`. `Preflight` takes the whole body, so read it under a byte cap first.
- Per-name limits such as "at most N `<item>` elements", which belong at your decode site.
- Decoder settings other than the defaults. If you turn `Strict` off or set an `Entity` map, the token, depth and element bounds still hold. The attribute and text bounds can then miss input, so treat them as a guide.

[What xmlx leaves out](docs/non-goals.md) gives the reason for each.

## Documentation

- [How xmlx bounds a document](docs/design.md) is for choosing bound values and reading a rejection.
- [What xmlx leaves out](docs/non-goals.md) is for deciding whether a case is in scope.
