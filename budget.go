// Budget is the decode-time text accounting for ONE document: a per-field cap on
// any single decoded value, and a cumulative cap on everything the document
// retains. It is the half of this package that Preflight cannot cover, because
// raw bytes and decoded text are different quantities: entity references, CDATA
// seams, and repeated elements all break the correspondence, so a document can
// pass every lexical bound and still hand a schema decoder more text than the
// caller means to hold.
//
// What it bounds is what the caller BUILDS and KEEPS. The per-token allocation
// happens inside encoding/xml before any check here can run, which is precisely
// why Preflight exists: only a gate over the raw bytes bounds what the decoder
// must materialize. The two are complements, not alternatives.
//
// Use one Budget per document, threaded through the decoders that charge it.
// Create it with NewBudget or DefaultBudget: the caps are immutable afterwards,
// so a document cannot be part-way through its allowance when the allowance
// changes. Copying a Budget would fork its running total, leaving two copies each
// believing they hold the whole allowance, so a copy is a vet error. It is not
// safe for concurrent use; a document decodes on one goroutine.
//
// A Budget does NOT bound element count or nesting. A caller using Budget alone
// still lets encoding/xml skip unknown children through Decoder.Skip, which is
// iterative and unbounded, so the decoder's element stack still grows to the
// document's true depth. Only Preflight bounds that.

// unbounded.
//
// Size maxTotalBytes from what the caller is willing to HOLD, which is usually
// far below the transport cap. A consumer parsing a catalogue-scale document
// sets it at that document's real ceiling; the DefaultBudget values are for a

//
// Call it BEFORE storing the value: a decoder that stores first and charges
// after has already kept the document it was about to reject.

// Every occurrence is charged, including repeats of the same element name. That
// is deliberate: a document that sends <title> ten thousand times overwrites one
// destination field but costs ten thousand decodes, so charging only the value
// that survives would leave that repetition unaccounted. Note the bound is on
// BYTES, so repetition of EMPTY values costs nothing here; bounding the number
// of elements is Limits.MaxElements's job, at the lexical gate.

// DecodeText reads the text content of the element the decoder has just entered,

// The difference that matters is WHEN the cap applies. DecodeElement
// concatenates every CharData token in the element and hands back the finished
// string, so a value split across CDATA seams, each chunk individually small
// enough to pass any lexical bound, is only measurable after it exists.
// DecodeText accumulates under the per-field cap AND under the document's
// remaining allowance, stopping at the token that would cross either, so the
// string it builds never exceeds what the caller would accept.
//
// Nested markup is skipped whole, matching DecodeElement's behavior for a
// plain-text destination; comments and processing instructions are ignored, as
// DecodeElement ignores them.
//
// On success the element's end tag is consumed, so the caller's token loop
// continues at the next sibling. On ANY error the document is over, and the
// caller must abandon it: a rejected value can leave the decoder part-way
// through the element, and a decoder error leaves it wherever encoding/xml
// stopped. There is no defined position to resume from.
